# RAG

This project illustrates RAG in a three steps project.


## document-ingestor
Responsible for ingesting documents into the Oracle DB23ai vector store. 

The document ingestion module is fully implemented in the `document-ingestor` subproject. It provides an end-to-end pipeline for ingesting documents ( pdf and text file ) into an Oracle vector store using a CLI:

- Parses PDF (and text) files into segments.
- Generates embeddings locally using `AllMiniLmL6V2QuantizedEmbeddingModel`.
- Stores vector and text data in an Oracle Vector Store.
- Includes all necessary service and persistence layers.

The README details complete setup and usage, including database provisioning, user configuration, application build, and CLI commands for both ingest and search workflows.


## rag-controller
Exposes a REST endpoint for interacting with an LLM and custom ingested PDF data. It can be configured to work with different AI providers, such as Ollama and OCI Generative AI Models.
2. Rely on this Vector store to populate LLM Context and give precise answers to users queries.



## rag-ihm
Serves a web interface or frontend for the RAG demo.
This IHM is entierly generated by Oracle Code Assit + Cline Agent

run the ihm module 
```sh
mvn clean install
